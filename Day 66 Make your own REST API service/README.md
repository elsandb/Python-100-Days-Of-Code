**cafe_app.py:** 
An API service in the form of a FlaskSQLAlchemy app.

The Coffee & Wi-Fi API offers information about cafés. For example, whether the café 
has Wi-Fi and power sockets, whether it is ok to talk on the phone, and the price of a 
regular black coffee. In other words, information that is useful to people who want 
to work from a café.

**cafes.db:**

made by course instructor Angela Yu.
